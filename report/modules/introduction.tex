\section*{Introduction}
For our final project we decided to implement some sentiment analysis techniques on social media data, and in particular on tweets from the social network Twitter. We used a dataset from Kaggle ~\cite{data:sentiment140} which contains 1.6 million tweets labelled as positive or negative (the dataset is balanced: there are 800k positive tweets and 800k negative tweets). We chose this topic because it is of course interesting from a research point of view, but it has also many applications in industry: for example we discovered some companies that provide sentiment analisys on social media as one of their main services ~\cite{startups:spiketrap} , these services are especially useful to other companies, for example to understand what their customers think about the release of new products (and in many similar scenarios).
